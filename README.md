# Interactive Notes

These are some of my notes on AI and related topics. The conversion from handwritten/markdown/remote notes to digital format is mostly taken care of by LLMs, so accuracy is not guaranteed.
The work is in progress, and I am open to contributions.

## Origins

A lot of the content here is based on the following documents/courses

- [Aman's AI Journey](https://www.aman.ai/)
- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/specializations/deep-learning/)
- [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/)
- [Stanford CS229](https://cs229.stanford.edu/)
- and many others

## From Read/Write to Kinesthetic

Most note-taking often falls squarely into the **Read/Write** category of the [VARK model](https://vark-learn.com/introduction-to-vark/the-vark-modalities/). While effective for some, it is not the way I usually want to learn, and it leaves a gap for people like me who learn best by *doing*.

Fortunately, LLMs can help bridge this gap a bit by creating interactive notes that allow me to interact with the material in a slightly more visual/kinesthetic way.

## Interactivity
A lot of articles have experimental interactive components, and hence a lot of interactivity may come across as superflous or unnecessary (especially for an expert audience). Feel free to create an issue to recommend interactive component that you might find useful (or better, send a PR!)

## AI Use Disclaimer
A substantion portion of the notes were converted by AI, so accuracy is not guaranteed. However, I have tried my best to verify the information and ensure its accuracy, and I still take ownership of the the mistakes. Feel free to create an issue (or better yet, PR) if you find any.
